Toby's master list of useful functions

PURPOSE:
The purpose of this repository is to compile all the useful functions that Toby has written over the years that are hopefully generic enough to be used in 
various scenarios and therefore worthwhile in keeping in a public repository for anyone's use, but mostly just for Toby to keep keep track of them all and easy
call them when needed. Some functions are at the present moment to specific to be of much use, or simply don't work right yet and thus are in the beta folder.
Scripts in the main folder should be more or less ready to go. Feel free to use them. Or do not. I'm not a beggar.

 2020-08-09: All functions currently are just functions and not full blown packages as of yet.
